## Scripts / scripts-public ##
This is a collection of scripts that I have developed and/or generated. (using generative AI) Most scripts are only compatible with Microsoft systems, (Windows, 365) but each script has a descriptive .txt file describing what it does.

### Installation ###
If Git is installed on your device, the repository can be cloned using:
```git clone https://github.com/ArranMcDougle/scripts-public.git``` via your terminal.
The file scripts-installer.bat within this repository can also be used to install Git+prerequisites, clone the repository and then enable Powershell Scripts on your local machine.

### Updating ###
New changes will be pushed to the repository at non-specific times. These can by obtained via standard fetch/pull methods or using the UPDATE.bat file, which will run the fetch/pull commands.
